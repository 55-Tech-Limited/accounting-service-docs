## API Documentation Updates

### Bet Ledger API

#### Make Bet Offer Endpoint
- 💥 **Breaking**: Removed `bet_id` field support (no longer accepted in requests)
- 💥 **Breaking**: Made `wager_reference` field required instead of optional
- ✨ **New**: `allowed_acceptor_ids` field - array of user IDs allowed to accept the bet offer
- ✨ **New**: `allowed_acceptor_references` field - array of user references allowed to accept the bet offer
- 📝 **Updated**: Documentation notes to explain allowed acceptor restrictions
- 📝 **Updated**: All code examples (cURL, JavaScript, Python, Rust) to demonstrate both open and restricted bet offers

#### Open Bets Endpoint
- ✨ **New**: `allowed_acceptor_ids` field to response structure to match `GetOpenBetsResponseDto`
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Better test coverage for get-open-bets endpoint functionality
- 🐛 **Fixed**: 500 error handling for `user_references` parameter

#### Batch Operations
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Comprehensive documentation for atomic batch operations
- ✨ **New**: Complete TypeScript type definitions for all 5 operation types
- 📝 **Updated**: Examples showing atomic behavior (all-or-nothing execution)
- ⚡ **Performance**: Batch requests now limited to maximum 20 requests per batch

#### Cancel Bet Offer Endpoint
- 💥 **Breaking**: `wager_reference` field replaced with `wager_references` array
- ✨ **New**: `wager_references` array support for canceling multiple offers
- ✨ **New**: `odds` filtering capability for selective cancellation
- 📝 **Updated**: Response examples with enhanced functionality

#### Exposure Calculations
- ✨ **New**: Comprehensive guide at `/docs/guides/exposure-calculations`
- 📝 **Updated**: `BetService.calculateExposure` algorithm with two-scenario analysis
- ✨ **New**: Code examples in TypeScript, Python, and Rust
- 📝 **Updated**: Mathematical formulas for exposure calculation
- 💥 **Breaking**: **Aggregate exposure calculation** considering multiple bet offers and acceptances (not backward compatible)
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Aggregate exposure logic into bet offer, acceptance, and cancellation workflows
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Portfolio-aware exposure calculations across all betting operations

### Users API

#### Get Paginated Users Endpoint
- ✨ **New**: `meta_*` field filtering support in query parameters
- 📝 **Updated**: Documentation to show how to filter users by metadata fields
- ✨ **New**: Examples for meta field filtering using pattern matching
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Filter by meta keys functionality for advanced user queries

#### User Management - New Endpoints Added
- ✨ **New**: **Update User By ID** endpoint (`PATCH /account/user/:userId`)
  - Full PATCH support for updating user information
  - Support for updating name, preferences, and metadata
  - Comprehensive validation and error handling
  - Complete code examples in cURL, JavaScript, Python, and Rust
  
- ✨ **New**: **Update User By Reference** endpoint (`PATCH /account/user/:reference/reference`)
  - Alternative update endpoint using user reference instead of ID
  - Same functionality as ID-based update but with reference parameter
  - Matching validation rules and response structure
  - Full multi-language code examples

#### Enhanced Meta Field Support
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Meta field validation documentation (max 10 fields, string values only)
- ✨ **New**: Detailed constraints documentation for meta fields
- 📝 **Updated**: Error response examples for meta field validation failures
- ✨ **New**: Examples showing proper meta field key naming (letters, numbers, underscores only)
- ✨ **New**: Meta field functionality to users for enhanced user categorization and management

### Transactions API

#### Transaction Improvements
- 🐛 **Fixed**: Removed `betTrail_id` field from transactions endpoint (deprecated)
- 📝 **Updated**: Documentation updated to reflect betTrail_id removal
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Transaction description accuracy and clarity

### Accept Bet Offer API

#### Enhanced Acceptance Flow
- ✨ **New**: `bet_id` field support to accept bet offer endpoint for direct bet identification
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: More flexible bet acceptance using either `wager_reference` or `bet_id`
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Streamlined acceptance process with multiple identification options

### Portfolio-Aware Endpoints

#### Outcome Management Updates
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: **Set Bet Active** endpoint to be portfolio-aware
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: **Set Bet Inactive** endpoint to be portfolio-aware  
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: **Force Update Bet Override Outcome** with portfolio awareness
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: **Force Update Wager Outcome** with portfolio awareness
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Wager outcome and bet override outcome calculations considering full portfolio context
- 🧪 **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for portfolio-aware functionality

### General Improvements
- 📝 **Updated**: All field references to use correct naming (`allowed_acceptor_ids` vs `allowed_accepting_user_ids`)
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Error response documentation across all endpoints
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Code examples with better error handling and realistic data
- ✨ **New**: Proper authorization header documentation references
- 📝 **Updated**: Response format examples across all new endpoints
- 🔧 **Enhanced**: Multi-language code support (cURL, JavaScript, Python, Rust) for all new endpoints

## Technical Notes

- All bet objects now include `allowed_acceptor_ids` field when applicable
- Batch operations are truly atomic - all operations succeed or all fail (limited to 20 requests per batch)
- Meta field filtering uses pattern matching for flexible user queries (`meta_tier`, `meta_status`, etc.)
- **Aggregate exposure calculations** now consider multiple bet offers and acceptances across portfolios
- **Portfolio-aware operations** ensure consistent state management across all betting activities
- User update endpoints support partial updates (only provided fields are modified)
- All new endpoints include comprehensive error handling and validation
- Field naming has been standardized across all documentation
- Transaction descriptions have been improved for better clarity
- Enhanced test coverage ensures reliability of all new features
- Accept Bet Offer endpoint now supports both `wager_reference` and `bet_id` for flexibility

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Make Bet Offer Endpoint**: No longer accepts `bet_id` field. Use `wager_reference` instead (now required).

⚠️ **Cancel Bet Offer Endpoint**: The `wager_reference` field has been replaced with `wager_references` (array). Use the plural form to cancel single or multiple bet offers.

⚠️ **Exposure Calculations**: The exposure calculation algorithm has been completely overhauled with aggregate portfolio-aware logic. This change is **not backward compatible** with previous versions. Applications relying on the previous exposure calculation behavior will need to be updated.
